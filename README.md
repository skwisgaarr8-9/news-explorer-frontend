# NewsExplorer

## About the project

This project serves as the final project in TripleTen's software engineering course. It was built using React, CRA, [News API](https://newsapi.org/), and is connected to a backend built for this project. Users are able to create logins and search for articles by keyword. When searched, a request is sent to News API to fetch 100 articles from the past week that relate to that keyword. The page will show 3 article cards at a time, showing three more when the see more button is pressed. Users can also save cards in their profiles for later reading.
